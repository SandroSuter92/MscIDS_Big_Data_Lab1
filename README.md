# MscIDS_Big_Data_Lab1

This repository contains the data and the analysis which was done during the module "Big Data Lab1". The goal was to fetch data via an API, load them into a MongoDB cluster and analyse the data with corresponding querries.

## Data

The used data were fetched from the [New York Times Archive API](https://developer.nytimes.com/apis). To run the code properly, an account should be registered. Alternative I uploaded the used data into the folder [Data](xxxx). This folder contains all published articles of the New York Times within the Year 2020 for each month.

## New York Times - Archive Research 2020

In the Jupyter Notebook, an analysis of the article archive of the internationally highly regarded New York Times is to be carried out as part of the Big Data Lab I module of the Master's programme "Applied Information and Data Science".

Goal and Objectives

The aim of this analysis is to apply and deepening the understanding of the material studied in class. For this purpose, the article archive of the New York Times from the year 2020 is analysed. A special focus is placed on articles with the theme of health. This is because the corona pandemic has broken out in 2020 and is therefore expected to have a strong influence in this category.

In order to take a closer look at the topic described above, the following questions should be answered by means of targeted queries in the MongoDB:

- Did the pandemic have an impact on the number of articles written in the New York Times?
- Who are the New York Times' top writers? and which section do they write?
- To what extent did the COVID-19 pandemic dominate the news coverage?
- How have the articles in the 'Health' section changed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic?
